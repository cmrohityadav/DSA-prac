Inheritance 

a class inherits properties of another class
class A  ------------------------------------------------> class B
parent class/super class                                child class/sub class

eg. 
                    class vehicle
                    tyre
                    capacity


class car                        class truck                                 class scooter
typre                            typre                                          typre                              
capacity                         capacity                                       capacity      



Access specifiers and modes of Inheritance
public: data and function -> they can be accessed from anywhere in code

private: acccessble only in own class

protected: accessible in own class, parent class and derived class




Type of Inheritance
1. Single Inheritance:
2.multi level Inheritance: parent class is derived from another class
3.multiple Inheritance
4.hierarchical Inheritance
5.hybrid Inheritance: combination  0f more than 1 Inheritance types



Diamond problem?
base class has multiple parent classes having a common ancestor class
