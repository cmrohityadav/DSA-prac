# Repeatdly swap two adjacent element if in wrong order
# Repeat=until once array is sorted
# i<n-1 pass
# j<n-1-i>
# time complexity=O(n2) //n square
# space complexity=O(1)


# stable sort: does not disturb the order of element with same value
         40 30 10 20 30`
# stable:  10 20 30 30` 40
 # unstable:10 20 30` 30 40
# Bubble sort is stable sort
