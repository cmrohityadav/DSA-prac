1. In recursion , we try to solve a bigger problem by finding out solution to smaller sub problem.
2. We represent these problems in the form of the function and this function call him self to slove smaller subproblem.
3. We usse principal of mathematical induction.
    i. base case
    ii. Assumption
    iii. Selfwork
4. space get introduce due to call stack
